\noindent The context and phrasing of a sentence sufficiently decide its emphasis.
In the example above, highlighting the interrogative pronoun/adverb is unnecessary, as the sentences are already constructed in a way that avoids any potential misunderstandings.
Also, it is generally not necessary to use italics for text within quotation marks.
