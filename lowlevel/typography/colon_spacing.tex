    The presented techniques for automated parameter adaptation are applied to nonlinear systems

    where $\highlightpartmath{f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n}$ is a sufficiently smooth nonlinear function, $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, and $u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the input vector.

The regular colon ``:'' is used in set builder notation as an alternative to a vertical bar and, less commonly, to express proportions.
In both cases, equal spacing on either side of the colon is appropriate to reflect the relationship between the elements.
Quantified expressions, however, are better represented with the less spacing to the left than to the right, as provided in \LaTeX{} by ``\textbackslash colon''.
