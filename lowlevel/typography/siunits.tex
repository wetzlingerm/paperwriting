    {Format SI units correctly.}

    To showcase the general concept of our approach, we first consider the deliberately simple example of an electric circuit consisting of a resistance $R = \highlightpartmath{2\Omega}$, a capacitor with capacity $C = \highlightpartmath{1.5 mF}$, and a coil with inductance $L = \highlightpartmath{\SI{0.0025}{\henry}}$.

\noindent Conveniently, the \LaTeX{} package ``siunitx'' ensures consistent formatting according to the SI standards.
The example above shows some of the most common mistakes:
Using italics for SI units, not using a space between the numbers and SI units, not using scientific notation.
