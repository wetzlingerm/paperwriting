    We consider uncertain linear time-invariant systems of the form
    \begin{align*}
        &\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + u(t) \\

    where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the system matrix, $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, and $u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the input vector.

\noindent The regular colon ``:'' is used in set builder notation as an alternative to a vertical bar and, less commonly, to express proportions.
In both cases, equal spacing on either side of the colon is appropriate to reflect the relationship between the elements.
Quantified expressions, however, do not consist of two independent parts, and are better represented with the spacing provided by ``\textbackslash colon''.
