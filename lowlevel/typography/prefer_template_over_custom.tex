    Our proposed algorithm has the following advantages and disadvantages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \item[\highlightpart{$+$}] Our verification algorithm can handle complex verification tasks involving time-varying specifications.
        \item[\highlightpart{$+$}] The autonomy of our approach enables practitioners to verify
        or falsify safety specifications with requiring specialized knowledge.
        \item[\highlightpart{$-$}] Other tools solve high-dimensional benchmarks often faster than our approach through tailored algorithms.
        \item[\highlightpart{$-$}] In cases where there is no initial uncertainty, our algorithm is unable to falsify the system, as the computed inner approximation of the reachable set will always be empty.

    Let us briefly address the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed approach:
    \highlightpart{A major advantage} of our verification algorithm is its ability to handle complex verification tasks involving time-varying specifications, and its autonomous nature allows practitioners to easily verify or falsify safety specifications without requiring specialized knowledge.
    \highlightpart{However}, our approach may be slower compared to other tools, which often solve high-dimensional benchmarks faster through tailored algorithms.
    \highlightpart{Additionally}, in cases where there is no initial uncertainty, our algorithm is unable to falsify the system, as the computed inner approximation of the reachable set will always be empty.

\noindent The formatting options provided by the \LaTeX{} template---such as headings, paragraphs, (un)ordered lists, and special environments (e.g., algorithms, tables, figures)---offer sufficient flexibility.
The need for custom formatting may suggest that the content is not well-structured or clearly phrased.
There are multiple ways to convert custom formatting into built-in formatting by using transitional phrases to establish a clear relationship between parts of the text (as used in the example above), by using a more rigid structural element that can be referenced, or by using an explanatory figure for more complex relationships.
