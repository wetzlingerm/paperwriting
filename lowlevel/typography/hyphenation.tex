\noindent \LaTeX{} implements the typographic convention that hyphenated words are not split across lines.
Since double-column formats are prone to splitting words due to the relatively short text width, one may easily encounter formatting issues when using (long) hyphenated words, such as ``outer-approximation'' in the example above.
The example also illustrates that some hyphenated words are standard adjectives where the hyphen is necessary, such as ``well-known'', ``high-level'', and ``real-time''.
