\noindent
There are two types of dashes: en dashes (--) and em dashes (---).
Their names originate from the relation of the length of the dash to the width of the letters ``N'' and ``M'', respectively; both are longer than a standard hyphen.
En dashes are used for ranges and connections, such as ``pages 1--10'' and ``North--South divide'', whereas em dashes are used for breaks in thought and emphasis.
Note that the publisher may prefer using commas or parentheses over dashes.
