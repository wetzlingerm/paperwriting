\noindent Generally, parentheses should be used sparingly in running text, as they offer supplementary information.
It's important to maintain a streamlined presentation that includes only relevant details---additional information is often better placed elsewhere, such as in a discussion section.
This principle is undermined when multiple parentheses are used in quick succession.
