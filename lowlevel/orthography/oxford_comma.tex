\noindent The Oxford comma is placed before the conjunction---most commonly, "and" and "or"---in a list of three or more items.
Many style guides, e.g., Chicago Manual of Style\footfullcite[Sec.~6.19]{ChicagoManualofStyle2017}, APA\footfullcite[Sec.~6.3]{APA2020}, and MLA\footfullcite[Sec.~2.2.5]{MLA2021}, recommend the Oxford comma for clarity and precision.
However, publishers may have their own specific guidelines, which may require omitting the Oxford comma.
