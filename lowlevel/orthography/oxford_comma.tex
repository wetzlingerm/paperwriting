\noindent The Oxford comma is placed before the conjunction---most commonly, "and" and "or"---in a list of three or more items.
Many style guides, e.g., Chicago Manual of Style, APA, and MLA, recommend the Oxford comma for clarity and precision.
However, publishers may have their own specific guidelines, which may require omitting the Oxford comma.
