    Each of the truncation orders $\eta_{\text{lin}}$ and $\eta_{\text{abs}}$ (Fig. 6b) reaches their maximum at the sharp turn as the dynamics there require more terms within the Taylor series of the exponential matrix to provide satisfactory accuracy.

\noindent Using the same font and font sizes in figures as in the running text allows the figure to blend seamlessly with the rest of the document, contributing to a cohesive overall appearance.
This is most easily achieved with the \LaTeX{} package \emph{TikZ}, as it compiles the text in figures using the same settings as the rest of the document.
