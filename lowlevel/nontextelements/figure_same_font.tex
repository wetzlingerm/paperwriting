\noindent Using the same font and font sizes in figures as in the running text allows the figure to blend seamlessly with the rest of the document, contributing to a cohesive overall appearance.
This is most easily achieved with the \LaTeX{} package \emph{TikZ}, as it compiles the text in figures using the same settings as the rest of the document.
