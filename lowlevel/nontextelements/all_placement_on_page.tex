\noindent Placing non-text elements at the top of the page or column offers several advantages:
First, these elements are easily accessible when referenced in the text.
Second, non-text elements often condense important information, warranting prominent placement, such as at the top of the page.
Third, this placement preserves the flow of the running text, contributing to optimizing space usage.
