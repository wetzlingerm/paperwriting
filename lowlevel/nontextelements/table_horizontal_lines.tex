\noindent Excessive use of horizontal lines can make a table look cluttered and hinder the reader's ability to quickly scan and interpret the data, as the structure provided by rows and columns is often enough to visually separate data.
Horizontal lines are primarily used for sectioning, e.g., between column headers and data, or between different segments of similar data.
