\noindent
Color vision deficiency affects approximately $8\%$ of men and $0.5\%$ of women worldwide, or roughly $1$ in $12$ men and $1$ in $200$ women \footfullcite{Gordon1998}.
As a result, it is highly likely that some readers would benefit from color choices that accommodate this condition.
The ``bad'' version in the example above uses only black lines to simulate how indistinguishable colors can appear to individuals with color vision deficiency.
