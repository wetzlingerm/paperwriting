\noindent The placement of non-text elements like figures, tables, and algorithms with respect to the running text is typically managed by \LaTeX{}, so readers often skip over them until a reference directs them to a specific element.
Therefore, it is good practice to explicitly reference each non-text element, ideally in a separate paragraph explaining its content.
% An alternative formulation to this guideline is:
% ``Only use environments if they are referenced at least once later.''
