    \textit{The model predictive robustness $\rho_p \in [-1, 1]$ quantifies the likelihood that the satisfaction or violation status of a predicate $p$ remains consistent over a finite prediction horizon.
    The robustness is assigned a positive sign if the predicate is satisfied, and a negative sign if it is violated.}

\noindent The additional sentence adds no new information, as reference $[1]$ is already included in the definition.
Readers are not expected to see all details repeated, only those the author deems relevant.
Moreover, they know to consult references for further details, as this is a primary purpose of citations.
