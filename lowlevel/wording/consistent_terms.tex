\noindent Consistency in terminology is crucial for ensuring the clarity of the presentation.
Different terms typically imply different meanings, so using them can lead readers to assume a distinction.
Inconsistent use of key terms indicates either uncertainty about the content or, at the very least, a lack of effort to refine the work.
