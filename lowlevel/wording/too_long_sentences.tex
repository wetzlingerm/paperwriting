\noindent As a simple rule of thumb, four lines in double-column format is a suitable threshold to determine whether a sentence is too long.
This threshold is less rigid in case of lengthy terms such as ``backward reachability analysis of nonlinear systems''.
One may also use the number of clauses as a metric to decide whether a sentence should be split in two sentences.
Finally, one can also read a sentence out loud and decide whether it is digestible.
