\noindent
The use of bits like ``the work in [1]'' or ``the authors in [2]'' does not add any value to the sentence, and is, therefore, redundant.
Any sentence should be readable while skipping the citation numbers, as if they were footnotes.
By consequence, the content is presented more compactly, and the text reads more fluidly.
