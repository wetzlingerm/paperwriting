    {Use italics for variable indices/superscripts and roman font for indices/superscripts that abbreviate words.}

\goodexample{
    Our adaptive cruise control operates with a planning period of $t$\highlightpart{$_{\text{p}}$}, i.e., it provides a new input at discrete planning times $t$\highlightpart{$_k$} $= k \Delta t$\highlightpart{$_{\text{p}}$} to be applied in the time interval $[t$\highlightpart{$_k$}$, t$\highlightpart{$_{k+1}$}$)$.
}

\noindent In the example above, the index ``p'' refers to the term ``planning period'' and is written in roman font.
In contrast, the index ``k'' refers to the variable time step $k$ and is written in italics.
