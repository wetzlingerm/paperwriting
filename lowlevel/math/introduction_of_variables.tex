\noindent
Explicitly mentioning the name and the domain is helpful because it prevents misunderstandings, especially for readers who may not be familiar with certain conventions or who may follow different ones.
The introduction of variables including a domain is of particular importance in definitions.
New variables in non-inlined equations should be introduced before or immediately after the equation environment.
