\noindent Above all, follow the Golden Rule and ensure consistency within your list of references.
This includes a consistent abbreviation of first names, a consistent number of authors before abbreviating the remainder with ``et al.'', a consistent title case or sentence case for title (this may differ from papers/articles to books), and a consistent abbreviation of book titles of conference proceedings and journal issues.

Please note that the formatting will ultimately depend on the publisher's \LaTeX{} template.
