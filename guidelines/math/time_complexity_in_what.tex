    Finally, we prove that the \highlightpart{time complexity} of our algorithm is \highlightpart{polynomial in the state dimension $n$}.

\noindent Often, the time/space complexity may be inferred from context.
However, the statement is incomplete without mentioning the variable with respect to which a certain behavior is exhibited.
This is particularly useful for readers who are skimming the text for this specific information.
