\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to my advisor Matthias and my mentor Niklas, who taught me most of what I know.
Many thanks also to my wonderful group of colleagues, and in particular Hanna, for mutual proofreading over many years as well as countless discussions on the craft of paper writing.
% TODO: Include proofreaders, e.g.: Special thanks to ... for proofreading early versions.
