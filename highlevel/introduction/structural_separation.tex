    If a computed outer approximation cannot verify safety, an inner approximation, \highlightpart{which is often computed based on outer approximations}, may falsify safety, instead. (...) \\

    Hence, one can obtain an inner approximation by contracting an outer approximation, as illustrated in [10, Fig. 2]:
    This has been shown for outer approximations computed via an \highlightpart{on-the-fly linearization of the nonlinear dynamics, yielding an affine dynamics and a higher-order dynamics, which also forms the basis of our approach}. \\

    While the Minkowski sum of the reachable sets for the affine and higher-order dynamics is a common method to compute outer approximations, we obtain inner approximations via the Minkowski difference of the aforementioned sets.

\noindent
The motivation sets the frame for the paper by introducing the broad research field and narrowing down to the specific research question.
Particular approaches addressing that research question are then surveyed in the related work.
Crucially, present your contributions separately from related work to avoid blurring the distinction between preexisting knowledge and the novelties from your work.
For longer introductions, consider using distinct subsections instead of paragraphs only.
