Related work often divides naturally into subtopics that offer distinct perspectives on the research question.
Help readers clearly distinguish these perspectives by dedicating one paragraph to each subtopic, and let the opening phrase of the first sentence act as an implicit header---as highlighted in the above example.
If the discussion of individual subtopics becomes extensive, use subsections instead of paragraphs to maintain clarity and structure.
