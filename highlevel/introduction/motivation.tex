    \location{Beginning of introduction} \\
    Formal methods can determine whether an uncertain dynamical system meets a given specification.
    Reachability analysis computes all states that are reachable under the given uncertainties, and, thus, can be used for formal verification [1].
    However, the exact reachable set cannot be computed except for special system classes [2];
    if a computed outer approximation cannot verify safety, an inner approximation may falsify safety, instead.

Commonly, the first sentence introduces the purpose and relevance of the research field.
After that, guide the reader from that broad context to the specific topic of the paper in a strictly sequential manner, with each key term in the opening sentences marking a clear step from coarse to fine.
Avoid circling back or shifting focus---move linearly toward the precise research topic.
