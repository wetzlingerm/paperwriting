\label{ch:introduction}

Commonly, the introduction section consists of three parts:
First, it presents the research field, motivatives its importance, and narrows down to the specific research question addressed by the paper.
Next, an overview of related work contextualizes the research question by discussing related questions and approaches, while identifying a gap in current knowledge or limitations of existing methods.
Finally, it concisely outlines the paper's contributions in addressing that gap.
