    {Consider presenting your contributions in a list.}

\goodexample[{Adapted from \cite[Sec.~I.]{Wetzlinger2025TAC}}]{
    Our contributions are as follows.
    \begin{compactitemize}[label=\colorbox{color_highlight}{\textbullet}]
        \item An inner and outer approximation of the time-point minimal backward reachable set (see Section V-A).
        \item An outer approximation of the time-interval minimal backward reachable set (see Section V-B).
        \item An inner and outer approximation of the time-point maximal backward reachable set (see Section VI-A).
        \item An inner approximation of the time-interval maximal backward reachable set (see Section VI-B).
    \end{compactitemize}

\noindent
A list is well-suited for presenting multiple contributions for several reasons:
First, a list stands out visually from the running text, thus framing its content in a highlight.
Second, a list emphasizes the individuality of each contribution.
Third, a list demands concise wording for each list entry, which in turn helps to communicate your work to the readers.
% You can use either an ordered or an unordered list, although the latter is likely more common.
For shorter works where the content revolves around presenting a single idea, prefer explaining that contribution using a couple of sentences in a dedicated paragraph.
