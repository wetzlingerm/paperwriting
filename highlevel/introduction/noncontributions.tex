    Our contributions are as follows:
    \begin{compactitemize}
        \item First, we present a novel reachability algorithm using support functions to compute inner-approximations (Sec. 4.2).
        \item Next, we design a fully-automated verification algorithm for the special case of unsafe sets given as halfspaces (Sec. 5.1).
        \item Moreover, we propose a fully-automated verification algorithm for arbitrary convex unsafe sets (Sec. 5.2).
        \item In case of a safety violation, our verification algorithms return a counterexample, which provides valuable insights to system engineers (Sec. 5.1-5.2).
        \item \highlightpart{The practical benefits of our novel algorithms are demonstrated on several challenging benchmark problems (Sec. 6)}.

\noindent
The contributions highlight how your work advances the state of the art and are closely tied to the main content of the paper.
Experiments serve primarily to validate these contributions, while code releases provide a reproducible implementation.
As such, it is better to mention experiments and implementations separately.
