    {Avoid mentioning methods and code releases as contributions.}

% EASY
% bad: separate bullet points for experiments -> better: mention in roadmap
% bad: selling methods that already exist as contribution because you use them for a new problem

\noindent ...
% what is a method: "we use X to do Y"... there must be more to it than just "i did it differently"
% put "we provide code" immediately after the contributions
