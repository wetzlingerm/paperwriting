    \location{Beginning of conclusion} \\
    We address the verification of safety specifications for linear time-invariant systems.
    Our proposed algorithm based on reachability analysis with support functions operates fully automatically and refines the tightness of the upper and lower bounds until safety can either be proven or disproven;

\noindent
he conclusion should offer a self-contained summary of the paper.
To achieve this, restate the overarching topic and concisely summarize the main contributions and results.
Because the reader is now familiar with the main body, you can include more detail than in the abstract.
