        % often shorter text because of lack of structural explanation (transition sentences and the like)
        % since the structure is unclear, one must traverse the entire path to find some specific information
        % heavier burden on what a reader must keep in mind when reading
        % difficult to separate high-level ideas from details, since mixed together
