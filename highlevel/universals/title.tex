    ``Inner Approximations of Reachable Sets for Nonlinear Systems Using the Minkowski Difference''
}

\noindent The title summarizes the topic of the paper, and potentially even the applied methodology, into its densest form.
We want the title to be as short as possible, while being as informative as possible.
Avoid words that do not add much value (like ``computing'' in the above example) and use short versions where the loss of information is negligible (like ``nonlinear systems'' instead of ``nonlinear dynamical systems'').
Still, include bits of methodology that set your paper apart from existing work (in the above example, ``using the Minkowski difference'' was the core element of our novel approach).
