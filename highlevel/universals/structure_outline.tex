Focus on the overall structure of the paper rather than specific details---there's no need to list references in the related work or write out equations.
Some content may already take shape as propositions, tables, or figures, which can be included in the outline.
A clear outline helps maintain focus on the main contributions and prevents getting lost in minor details.
Keep in mind that the outline is not fixed and will likely evolve as the writing progresses.
