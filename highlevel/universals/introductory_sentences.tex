    To achieve this, we first derive closed-form expressions describing how the individual errors depend on the values of each parameter \highlightpart{in Section IV-A}.
    Next, we present our automated parameter tuning algorithm \highlightpart{in Section IV-B} and prove its convergence \highlightpart{in Section IV-C}.
