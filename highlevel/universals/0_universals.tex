\label{ch:universals}

In this chapter, we take a brief look at some guideline that do not belong to a specific paper section, but are instead universally applicable.
This includes defining the overall structure of the paper, ensuring a logical flow from one section to the next, as well as the notion of layered writing, allowing to address readers with different interests:
those intending to read the paper entirely, and those only searching for a specific information.
