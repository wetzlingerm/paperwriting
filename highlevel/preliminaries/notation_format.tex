    \highlightpart{Let us first introduce some notation:}
    Vectors are denoted by lowercase letters, matrices by uppercase letters, and sets by calligraphic letters.
    For a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$, v(i) denotes its $i$th coordinate; for a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, we use $M_{(i,\cdot)}$ and $M_{(\cdot,j)}$ to denote the $i$th row and $j$th column, respectively.
    (...)
    % The transposes of a vector and matrix are written as $v^\top$ and $M^\top$, respectively.
    % Comparisons between two vectors, such as $v_1 \leq v_2$, are evaluated element-wise.
    % We use $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ for an all-zero or all-ones vector or matrix of proper size, and $I_n$ to denote the $n$-dimensional identity matrix.
    % The canonical basis vector in the $i$th dimension is written as $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
    % The closed Euclidean ball around the origin with radius $\varepsilon > 0$ is denoted by $B_\varepsilon$.
    % For a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $\mathrm{span}(M) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ is the set $\{Mx | x \in \mathbb{R}^n\}$, and $\mathrm{span}(M)^\bot$ is its orthogonal complement, i.e., the set $\{y \in \mathbb{R}^m | \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon y^\top Mx = 0\}$.
    % The symbols $\top$ and $\bot$ denote true and false, respectively.

As an author, it is impossible to foresee the many different audiences that your work may reach.
Since there likely exist conflicting conventions across those audiences, spend some lines on introducing the used notation  to avoid making assumptions on what a reader must know to easily follow your work.
There is no need to introduce notation that can be considered school knowledge.
Yet, when in doubt, it is still better to clarify specific notation than to open yourself up to a potential misunderstanding.
