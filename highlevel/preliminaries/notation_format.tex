    \highlightpart{Let us first introduce some notation:}
    Vectors are denoted by lowercase letters, matrices by uppercase letters, and sets by calligraphic letters.
    For a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $v_(i)$ denotes its $i$th coordinate; for a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, we use $M_{(i,\cdot)}$ and $M_{(\cdot,j)}$ to denote the $i$th row and $j$th column, respectively.

It is impossible to foresee the many different audiences that your work may reach.
Since there likely exist conflicting conventions across those audiences, spend some lines on introducing the used notation  to avoid making assumptions on what readers must know to easily follow your work.
While there is no need to introduce notation that can be considered school knowledge, it is still better to clarify specific notation than to open yourself up to a potential misunderstanding.
