    {Use the preliminaries as a dense look up for the main body.}

% example in two parts: preliminaries (...) usage in main body
% good: everything for main body is provided
% bad: introduce information when first needed, but needed multiple times
% (if needed only once, then maybe debatable... but still better to separate own work and existing work = preliminaries)

\noindent ...
% ideally, people who are familiar with notation/theory can skip the preliminaries
