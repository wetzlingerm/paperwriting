    Given a random direction $\ell \in \mathbb{R}^r, \left\| \ell \right\|_2 = 1$, we compute the support vector $\widehat{y}(\ell)$ associated to the support function of the computed outer approximation $\widehat{\mathcal{Y}}([0,t_{\text{end}}])$, i.e.,
    \begin{equation*}
        \widehat{y}(\ell) = \rho \big( \widehat{\mathcal{Y}}([0,t_{\text{end}}]), \ell \big) = \max_{k \in \{0,\dots,\omega - 1\}} \rho \big( \widehat{\mathcal{Y}}(\tau_k) , \ell \big) ,
    \end{equation*}
    \highlightpart{where the support function in a direction $\ell \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined by $\rho(\mathcal{S},\ell) \coloneqq \max_{x \in \mathcal{S}} \ell^\top x$}.

\noindent
Ideally, preliminaries are written in a way that allows readers already familiar with the research topic or notation to skip them.
Avoid introducing essential concepts at the point of first use in the main body, especially if they are referenced multiple times throughout the paper.
Even if a concept is used only once, it is preferable to place prior knowledge in the preliminaries section for a clear separation from your contributions.
