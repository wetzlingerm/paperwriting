    {Ensure your notation follows standard conventions.}

% EASY
% take some equation of preliminaries that uses these standard conventions
% TODO: separate guideline for following wording conventions?
% good: t for continuous time, W for a weight matrix, ...
% bad: use other variables than the conventional ones, because they are used for specific stuff (e.g., t is ..., but time is s)
