\noindent
While every notation is valid if properly introduced, some are more intuitive to the majority of your audience than others.
As you are likely very familiar with your specific research domain, avoid unnecessary deviations from the existing conventions.
This also helps readers in studying multiple papers concurrently, as the translation effort is minimized.
