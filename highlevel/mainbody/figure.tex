Figures enable the simultaneous presentation of multiple pieces of information, unlike paragraphs, which require sequential reading and sustained focus from the reader.
When illustrating workflows, it is often helpful to break down each step into separate subfigures, allowing the full process to emerge from the sequence.
Such figures can be dense, as their purpose is to convey the overarching idea clearly and accuratelyâ€”precise labeling is essential to achieve this.
