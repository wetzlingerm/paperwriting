    Let us first \highlightpart{introduce our high-level idea} for computing an outer approximation of (43):
    Note that the intersection of any number of $\mathcal{R}_\exists(-\tau; u^*(\cdot))$ in (43) always leads to a sound outer approximation.
    Obviously, we want a tight outer approximation, that is, a small intersection stemming from a well selected, finite number of input trajectories $u^*(\cdot) \in \mathbb{U}$.
    For this selection, we use a heuristic approach via support function reachability, which simplifies the intersection of the individual reachable sets in (43).
