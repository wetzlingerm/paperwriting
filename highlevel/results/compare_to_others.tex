    We demonstrate the performance of Algorithm 1, implemented in the MATLAB toolbox CORA [26], on several benchmarks and \highlightpart{compare it to the scaling approach [10], implemented also in CORA, and the projection approach [5], implemented in the C++ toolbox RINO [6]}.

\noindent
Every contribution is embedded in the research landscape next to similar results from related work.
Only a comparison with other approaches allows for an accurate assessment of the quality of your contributions.
Such a comparison may be difficult if other approaches make slightly different assumptions in their problem statement.
In this case, try to find common ground in a simpler example, or explicitly address the differences between the compared approaches in the discussion of the results.
