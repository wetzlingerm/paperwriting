    We demonstrate the performance of Algorithm 1, implemented in the MATLAB toolbox CORA [26], on several benchmarks and \highlightpart{compare it to the scaling approach [10], implemented also in CORA, and the projection approach [5], implemented in the C++ toolbox RINO [6]}.

\noindent
Every contribution is embedded in the research landscape next to similar results from related work.
It is of utmost importance to present a comparison with other approaches so that the quality of your contributions can be accurately assessed.
As other approaches may make different assumptions about the problem at hand, they may not be fully compatible with your approach.
In this case, try to find common ground in a simpler example, or explicitly highlight the differences between your approach and others in the discussion of the results.
