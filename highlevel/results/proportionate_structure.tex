    \textit{6.1 ARCH benchmarks} \\
    In the annual ARCH competition, state-of-the-art reachability tools compete to efficiently verify a set of benchmarks.

\noindent
Examples numerically analyze the contributions from the main body.
As these contributions form a story of increasing complexity, even culminating in a single theorem or algorithm, let the examples follow that story explicitly, using subsections for each part.
Ideally, the resulting subsections are roughly of equal length, thereby giving similar importance to each example.
