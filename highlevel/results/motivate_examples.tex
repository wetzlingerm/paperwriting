\noindent
Explain why each example was chosen.
For instance, you might use a simple example to illustrate a core concept, a larger one to demonstrate scalability, or a challenging benchmark for comparison with the state of the art.
Avoid merely listing examples or their sources without clarifying their purpose or relevance.
