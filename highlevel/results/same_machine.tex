    We demonstrate the \highlightpart{performance of Algorithm 1}, implemented in the MATLAB toolbox CORA [26], on several benchmarks and \highlightpart{compare it to the scaling approach} [10], implemented also in CORA, \highlightpart{and the projection approach} [5], implemented in the C++ toolbox RINO [6].
    \highlightpart{All computations} are performed on a 2.60GHz i7 processor with 32GB memory.

\noindent
If timing is relevant, running all evaluations on the same machine ensures a level playing field for comparison between approaches.
System specifications can significantly impact the timings, so keeping them consistent helps isolate differences in performance.
Of course, this may not be possible if the code for certain approaches is not available.
