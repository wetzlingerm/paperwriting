    Additionally, we provide a \highlightpart{comparison to the multi-parametric toolbox} in terms of the computation times for an increasing dimension.
    \highlightpart{All computations} are carried out on an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H processor with a 3.30 GHz Radeon Graphics unit and 16GB memory.

If timing is relevant, running all evaluations on the same machine ensures a level playing field for comparison between approaches.
System specifications can significantly impact the timings, so keeping them consistent helps isolate differences in performance.
Of course, this may not be possible if the code for certain approaches is not available.
