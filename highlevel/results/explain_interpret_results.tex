\noindent
While the raw data of the numerical evaluation is best presented in a table, it is still good practice to briefly summarize the results in the running text.
Furthermore, provide an explanation for general trends by linking to the properties of all approaches that were run.
Also, explain surprising findings---often, these cases have a particular exploitable structure.
