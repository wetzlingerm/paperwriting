\chapter{Title, Abstract, and Keywords}
\label{ch:abstract}

Every paper starts with the same three text elements---title, abstract, and keywords.
The title is the prime reference point of each paper, capturing its essence in few yet expressive words.
We will use a running example for the guidelines in this chapter \cite[Abstract]{Wetzlinger2024CSL}.

The abstract provides a concise summary of the paper:
In order, it motivates and states the research question, highlights the limitations of existing methods, presents the main approach and its advantages, discusses the results of the evaluation, and provides a brief conclusion.
A well-written abstract helps readers quickly determine the paper's relevance to their interests.
