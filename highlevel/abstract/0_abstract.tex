\chapter{Title, Abstract, and Keywords}
\label{ch:abstract}

Every paper starts with the same threefold pattern---title, abstract, and keywords.
The title is the reader's first point of contact and frames the interpretation of everything that follows.
The abstract provides a concise summary of the paper.
In order, it motivates and states the research question, highlights the limitations of existing methods, presents the main approach and its advantages, and discusses the results of the evaluation.
A well-written abstract helps readers quickly determine the paper's relevance to their interests.
Finally, the keywords represent additional terms that embed the paper into the scientific landscape.

We will use a running example for the guidelines in this chapter \cite[Abstract]{Wetzlinger2024CSL}.
