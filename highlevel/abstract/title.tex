    \badexpl{The word ``computing'' does not add much value as most papers are concerned with computation, the term ``nonlinear dynamical systems'' is wordy yet inaccurate;
    crucially, the paper's unique selling point is missing, such as the core idea of the algorithm.}

\noindent The title summarizes the topic of the paper, and potentially even the applied methodology, into its densest form.
We want the title to be as short as possible while being as informative as possible.
Avoid words that do not add much value and use short versions where the loss of information is negligible.
Still, include bits of methodology that set your paper apart from existing work.
