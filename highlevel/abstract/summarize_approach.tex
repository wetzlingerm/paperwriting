    (...), we \highlightpart{directly obtain sound inner approximations by using the Minkowski difference} in a reachability algorithm for nonlinear systems.
    Our implementation uses a \highlightpart{combination of polytopes and constrained zonotopes} as set representations, resulting in a \highlightpart{low polynomial time complexity in the state dimension}.
