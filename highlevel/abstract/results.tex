\noindent
If your work contains an evaluation section, succinctly summarize the obtained results.
This part should mention the datasets used for the evaluation, which are either custom examples or well-known benchmarks, and the approaches against which the proposed approach is compared, including metrics, such as accuracy or computation time.
Do not go into excessive detail here to avoid needlessly bloating the summary, as only the core message matters.
Finally, provide a conclusive interpretation of the results, which expresses why this contribution is of practical relevance.
